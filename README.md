Hello all!

My name is Harrison and this is a place for me to showcase my work and passions.

I am looking to grow my experience in front end web dev and this is my journey.

Most of the websites I program are given for free to non profits, mom and pop shops or small companies to grow their web presence and give me experience.

Please help me get better by leaving comments or directly email me things you think could help at hriveradev@gmail.com
